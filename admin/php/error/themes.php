<h2>We are sorry but our ChangeTheme service is not up and running yet. However we discribe below how to manually change the themes.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open main.css located in <em>admin/main.css</em>. Becuase our automated Color Scheme service is not yet operationial you may use any color that you wish. Inside <em>main.css</em> you will notice under the section "Basic Page Layout" and "Menus" that the value of some of the variables is #'027ac6' replace those all the values with the default color scheme with the HTML hex color codes that you prefer. Upload and test the page.</p>
